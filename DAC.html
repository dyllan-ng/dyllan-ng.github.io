        <p>We are a shelter that help dogs and cats<br>
        We will give them a comfartable bed so they can live normally<br>
        We are doing this because dogs and cats don't deserve to stay outside <br>
        and not being taken care of</p>
        <h2>
            What are you about?
        </h2>
        <p>We are about a shelter that helps dogs and cats <br>
        because they could cause car accidents by walking
        towards a moving car and get injured.<br> So, we will
        bring them in the shelter so we can keep them safe
        in this shelter</p>
